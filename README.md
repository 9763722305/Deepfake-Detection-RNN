# Deepfake-Detection-RNN

An advanced deepfake detection system that leverages a hybrid CNN-RNN architecture to identify manipulated video content. This project combines spatial and temporal analysis to detect deepfakes with high accuracy.

##  Overview

Deepfake technology enables the creation of hyper-realistic synthetic videos, posing significant challenges to content authenticity. This project implements a deepfake detection system that:

- Extracts spatial features using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Models temporal dependencies with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically LSTM or GRU units
- Fuses spatial and temporal features to improve detection performance

The system is designed to work with video sequences, analyzing subtle temporal inconsistencies that often signal deepfake manipulation.

##  Features

- 1) **Video Frame Extraction**: Processes videos into individual frames.
- 2) **Hybrid Model**: CNN for spatial feature extraction + RNN (LSTM/GRU) for temporal modeling.
- 3) **Bidirectional RNN**: Looks at both past and future frames for better context.
- 4) **Data Augmentation**: Adds variability (lighting, pose, expression) to improve robustness.
- 5) **Regularization**: Dropout and other techniques to prevent overfitting.
- 6) **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score for comprehensive evaluation.

- CPU: Pentium IV 2.4 GHz or better
- RAM: 512 MB minimum (2 GB+ recommended)
